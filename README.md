# Block Party

## Description

Block Party is a classic Breakout-style game with a small twist: all the blocks have effects! Some blocks will explode, some will spawn more blocks, and some will even spawn powerups! 

## How to Play

The game is currently in development, so there is no way to play it yet. However, you can download the source code and run it in <a href="https://unity.com/download" title="unity version">Unity version 2022.3 LTS</a>. 

For a stable version, fork the [`main`](https://github.com/DigitalNaut/BlockParty/tree/main) branch. For the latest version, fork the [`dev`](https://github.com/DigitalNaut/BlockParty/tree/dev) branch.

## For Developers

While I try to keep a clear and discrete commit history, I don't always succeed during the early phases of development when it's less impactful. So be warned that half of the game files may change from one commit to the next!

### How to Contribute

If you want to contribute to the project, fork the [`dev`](https://github.com/DigitalNaut/BlockParty/tree/dev) branch and make a pull request. I'll review it and merge it into the main branch if it's good. It helps if you provide a description of what you changed and why you changed it.
